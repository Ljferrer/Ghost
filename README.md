# Ghost

I'm planning on fine tuning [BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270) on rap lyrics and calling it Lil BERT. 

## Lil BERT will be your Ghost Writer: 

The idea is to make an interactive, mad-lib style poetry generator where the user "asks" for words with [MASK] tokens.


### Dataset: 
Using [1362 Hip Hop artists metioned on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians) (accessed on 2019-05-22), the lyrics were scraped from [Genius](https://genius.com).
